Computer Vision and Facial recognition softwareâ€™s on mobile applications from
Facebook, Instagram, Tik-Tok or Snapchat have been exploding across the social
network platforms. Recognizing different actions from a given sequence of visual
observations from initial and final state conditions provide basis of parameters for
neural networks to learn and train sequential models. This kind of video footage can be
applied to almost any industry from tracking health care to video surveillance and even
perform human to computer interactions. However, reliable and precise vision-based
systems still remain to be one of the biggest challenges in the field of computer visions.
This can only be done with the advancement and development of computer vision
program applications, until a general AI vision-based system can accommodate the
majority of human action recognition objectives. To further the advancement of this
field, a vast proportion of research needs to be fast-tracked through multi-modalitybased 
recognition systems that are fluid and cohesive within each application that
requires interactions between human and computer vision systems. In this paper we
discuss several methodologies, comparisons and future recommendations to guide the
advancement of computer vision systems for action recognition.
